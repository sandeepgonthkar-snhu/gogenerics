                    Access to essential medicines is very crucial to every human being and this is problematic to one-third of the population worldwide. The price of many medicines is unaffordable to most of the population in need, especially in least-developed countries, but also increasingly in middle-income countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generic Drugs plays a vital role in solving the accessibility (affordability) issue of the essential medicines. A generic drug is a pharmaceutical drug that is equivalent to a brand name product in dosage, strength, kinetics, and way of administration, quality, and its intended use. It may also refer to any drug, which is promoted under its chemical name without advertising. Generics are essential since they are necessarily less-expensive choices to their brand name equivalents. The accessibility and use of generic choices to brand name drugs have an important result on cost savings for health care users.

                <p>
                    Although Generics are as good as branded drugs their availability is not well known outside a handful of medical professionals, hence in many countries they are not widely popular and used.  One study in India found that although India being one of the largest manufacturers and exporters of generic drugs, the actual usage in the country is very low. This is due to various factors and one important factor is lack of information regarding the generic drug. This has severely impacted many lives as they may not be able to afford branded drugs.

                    General population does not have access to information about the availability of Generic drugs for a prescribed branded drug. There is no one stop solution where a patient and easily find if there exists a generic drug for the treatment he is about to receive. This drug could be a simple fever reducer, pain killer, Blood pressure medication or more complex lifesaving drug.
